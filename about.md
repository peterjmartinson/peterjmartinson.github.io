Good Day &#151; I am a full stack web developer and data wrangler who reads books and loves space.

My preferred stack is JavaScript and Node.js, though I have dabbled in LAMP.  My PHP goes further back, but for the last two years I have been teaching myself JavaScript through sundry resources, like [{ freeCodeCamp }](https://www.freecodecamp.com/peterjmartinson).  Examples of my projects are live on [{ CodePen }](https://codepen.io/peterjmartinson/pens/public/) and raw on [{ GitHub }](https://github.com/peterjmartinson).  Getting close to the **edge** is my passion &#151; Code that is terse yet pleasant to read, science that straddles [{ astrophysics and geology }](http://stonetelescope.wordpress.com).  My JavaScript is so clean it can be sung to a baby.  My SQL inner joins to outer space.  Please see case studies of my work [{ here }](https://peterjmartinson.github.io/projects/).
