Good Day &#151; I am a full stack web developer and data wrangler who reads books and loves space.

My preferred stack is JavaScript and Node.js, though I have dabbled in LAMP.  My PHP goes further back, but for the last two years I have been teaching myself JavaScript through sundry resources, like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/peterjmartinson" target="_blank">{freeCodeCamp}</a>.  Examples of my project are live on <a href="https://codepen.io/peterjmartinson/pens/public/" target="_blank">{CodePen}</a> and raw on <a href="https://github.com/peterjmartinson" target="_blank">{GitHub}</a>.  Getting close to the <strong>edge</strong> is my passion &#151; Code that is terse yet pleasant to read, science that straddles <a href="http://stonetelescope.wordpress.com" target="_blank">{astrophysics and geology}</a>.  My JavaScript is so clean it can be sung to a baby.  My SQL inner joins to outer space.  Please see case studies of my work below.
