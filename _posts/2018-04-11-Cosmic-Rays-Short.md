_A few weeks ago, a paper appeared that caught my imagination.  [Update on the worsening particle radiation environment observed by CRaTER and implications for future human deep-space exploration](LINK), by Schwadron et al., details the results of a cosmic ray experiment in orbit around the moon.  There is a lot to unpack in this paper in terms of both information and just interesting and exciting implications.  So, instead of handing you, dear reader, an hour's worth of reading, I'll break it up into a few parts.  This is part one._

### Introduction

The quietest spot in the solar system is on the dark side of the full moon. On these nights, the moon blocks out all the sunlight, as well as all the radio and other electromagnetic radiation from the Earth.  It's the most serene spot in the solar system to do astronomy.  But, things have been getting louder there recently.

Earlier this year, [Schwadron et al.](LINK) reported on observations by the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter's CRaTER instrument (abstract printed below).  This instrument was specially designed to measure cosmic ray intensity when the Sun is shielded behind our moon.  The report states that cosmic ray intensity is now the highest it has been since we started measuring cosmic rays, and it's getting more intense [faster than expected](LINK previous paper).

Cosmic rays are the electrically charged nuclei of atoms, hurtling through space at incredible speeds.  There are two flavors of these little morsels.  One type comes from the sun, and are called _solar energetic particles_, or SEPs.  The other type are generally thought to have been blasted out of supernovae, and then accelerated around the Milky Way and other galaxies by intense intergalactic magnetic fields.  These are called _galactic cosmic rays_, or GCRs.

Both types of speed demon are so small and so fast that a few may have shot through your body in the time it took to read this sentence.  But sometimes, those cosmic rays hit other atoms.  When they do, the effects can range from cosmic ray showers [[???]], to lightning, cloud formation, [malfunctioning Toyotas](link), [heart attacks](link), or even cancer.

[Schwadron et al.](LINK) showed that, if the cosmic ray hail keeps intensifying at the rate it has over the past five years, it will become an increasingly dramatic risk to, specifically, our astronauts.

### The details

In 2009, the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter (LRO) launched with an instrument designed to study the cosmic ray environment around the moon.  This instrument, called the [Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER)](http://crater.sr.unh.edu/), was outfitted specifically to model the cosmic ray effects on humans, both with and without shielding.

In late 2013 through 2014, a series of articles came out that detailed the initial findings.  One of these papers, [Does the worsening galactic cosmic radiation environment observed by CRaTER preclude future manned deep space exploration?](LINK), by Schwadron et al., definitively warned that it was looking pretty bad for the astronauts.

They combined cosmic ray measurements made by CRaTER with those made by the [Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)](LINK) spacecraft to build a picture of the environment going back to about the year 2000.  They then used a model to relate the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux to the strength of the solar cycle, as indicated by sunspot number, going back to about 1950.  Combining these two sets of data (observation plus model), they were then able to make a forecast about the GCR flux for the coming solar minimum, depending on just how deep the minimum goes.

They noted that, based on GCR flux measured by ACE during the previous solar minimum (~2009), male astronauts would have reached their recommended limit of GCR exposure within 400 days, and female astronauts would have reached theirs within 300.  Based on forecasts of the next solar minimum (~2019), the CRaTER observations indicated exposure times would decrease by about 20%:  about 320 days for male astronauts, and about 240 days for female.  Given about six months to travel from Earth to Mars, and then six months back, a crew would easily exceed their GCR dose rates and enter dangerous territory.

In the latest paper, [Update on the worsening particle radiation environment observed by CRaTER and implications for future human deep-space exploration](LINK), Schwadron et al. revisit this prediction, since we're almost in the middle of solar minimum.  They included estimates for how astronauts would handle large solar flares as well, using the X9 flare of September 10, 2017 for an example.  Their conclusion?  The 2014 paper overestimated the friskiness of our sun, and underestimated the intensity of galactic cosmic rays, by about 10%.  In other words, astronauts will be able to spend even less time than expected in deep space, because the cosmic ray environment was getting worse faster than expected.

Why was their prediction so far off?

### What's up with the Sun?

"That's a very good and a very hard question," said Nathan Schwadron, principal investigator for the CRaTER experiment.  "I am not sure why the dose rates are going up so quickly.  [But] I suspect two issues:

"1) The magnetic fields in the solar system are weakening more rapidly than we anticipated.  This has the effect of allowing more radiation into the solar system.

"2) The drift of cosmic rays has changed dramatically due to a recent reversal in the dominant polarity of the magnetic field within the solar system. This is a natural solar cycle effect, but may be accentuated due to the weak strength in the magnetic field."

Every 11 years or so, the sun goes through a cycle.  This cycle is observed through increasing and decreasing numbers of sunspots, magnetic field strength, and other forms of solar emanations.  Humans have observed this cycle since about the 1600s, and these observations form one of the longer records of continuous human measurement.  Right now, in mid-2018, we're at the tail end of Cycle 24.  Solar minimum is predicted to hit around 2019-2020.  

The flux of GCRs follows this cycle.  During solar maximum, the GCR flux is low.  During minimum, it's high.  When the charged GCRs pass through the Sun's farflung magnetic field, they experience a torque.  The net effect of this torque is that the GCRs don't make it very deep into the solar system before getting redirected back out again.  When the solar magnetic field is strong, during solar maximum, only a few, very high speed GCRs make it to the Earth.  When the field is weak, during solar minimum, more GCRs can get to us, including lower energy ones.  

And this is normal.  Schwadron et al. provide some fancy images to demonstrate this.
