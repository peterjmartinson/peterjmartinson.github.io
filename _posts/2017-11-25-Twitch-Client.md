## Description

Twitch Client allows a user to see whether certain streamers are streaming on [{ TwitchTV }](https://www.twitch.tv).  The user gets different responses depending on whether 1. the streamer exists, 2. the streamer is currently streaming, or 3. the streamer is currently not streaming.  Currently, the list of potential streamers is hard-coded into the application, but a future plan is to add a search feature.

## Execution

The project uses the [{ TwitchTV API }](https://dev.twitch.tv/), which is touched by [{ jQuery }](https://jquery.com) AJAX handlers.
