### It's been raining cats and dogs!

The quietest spot in the solar system is on the dark side of the full moon. On these nights, the moon blocks out all the sunlight, as well as all the radio and other electromagnetic radiation from the Earth.  It's the most serene spot in the solar system to do astronomy.  But, things have been getting louder there recently.

Earlier this year, [Schwadron et al.](LINK) reported on observations by the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter's CRATER instrument (abstract printed below).  This instrument was specially designed to measure cosmic ray intensity when the Sun is shielded behind our moon.  The report states that cosmic ray intensity is now the highest it has been since we started measuring cosmic rays, and it's getting more intense [faster than expected](LINK previous paper).

Cosmic rays are the electrically charged nuclei of atoms, hurtling through space at incredible speeds.  These little speed demons are generally thought to have been blasted out of supernovae, and then accelerated around the Milky Way and other galaxies by intense intergalactic magnetic fields.  They're so small and so fast that a few may have shot through your body in the time it took to read this sentence.

Sometimes, those cosmic rays hit other atoms.  When they do, the effects can range from cosmic ray showers [[???]] to, potentially, cancer.

[Schwadron et al.](LINK) showed that, if the cosmic ray hail keeps intensifying at the rate it has over the past five years, it will become an increasingly dramatic risk to our astronauts.

### The details

_Back in 2014, Obama was still president, and NASA's goal was to send astronauts into deep space, somewhere.  By "deep space", we mean beyond low earth orbit (LEO).  By "somewhere", we mean probably a trip to a near earth asteroid._

In 2009, the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter (LRO) launched with an instrument designed to study the cosmic ray environment around the moon.  This instrument, called the [Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER)](http://crater.sr.unh.edu/), was outfitted specifically to model the cosmic ray effects on humans, both with and without shielding.

In late 2013 through 2014, a series of articles came out that detailed the initial findings.  One of these papers, [Does the worsening galactic cosmic radiation environment observed by CRaTER preclude future manned deep space exploration?](LINK), by Schwadron et al., definitively warned that it was looking pretty bad for the astronauts.

They combined cosmic ray measurements made by CRaTER with those made by the [Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)](LINK) spacecraft to build a picture of the environment going back to about the year 2000.  They then used a model to relate the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux to the strength of the solar cycle, as indicated by sunspot number, going back to about 1950.  Combining these two sets of data (observation plus model), they were then able to make a forecast about the GCR flux for the coming solar minimum, depending on just which minimum we end up with (more on this below).

They noted that, based on GCR flux measured by ACE during the previous solar minimum (~2009), male astronauts would have reached their recommended limit of GCR exposure within 400 days, and female astronauts would have reached theirs within 300.  Based on forecasts of the next solar minimum (~2019), the CRaTER observations indicated exposure times would decrease by about 20%:  about 320 days for male astronauts, and about 240 days for female.  Given about six months to travel from Earth to Mars, and then six months back, a crew would easily exceed their GCR dose rates and enter dangerous territory.

In the latest paper, [Update on the worsening particle radiation environment observed by CRaTER and implications for future human deep-space exploration](LINK), Schwadron et al. revisit this prediction, since we're almost in the middle of solar minimum.  They included estimates for how astronauts would handle large solar flares as well, using the X9 flare of September 10, 2017 for an example.  Their conclusion?  The 2014 paper overestimated the friskiness of our sun, and underestimated the intensity of galactic cosmic rays, by about 10%.  In other words, astronauts will be able to spend even less time than expected in deep space, because the cosmic ray environment was getting worse faster than expected.

Why was their prediction so far off?

### What's up with the Sun?

"That's a very good and a very hard question," said Nathan Schwadron, principal investigator for the CRaTER experiment.  "I am not sure why the dose rates are going up so quickly.  [But] I suspect two issues:

"1) The magnetic fields in the solar system are weakening more rapidly than we anticipated.  This has the effect of allowing more radiation into the solar system.

"2) The drift of cosmic rays has changed dramatically due to a recent reversal in the dominant polarity of the magnetic field within the solar system. This is a natural solar cycle effect, but may be accentuated due to the weak strength in the magnetic field."

Every 11 years or so, the sun goes through a cycle.  This cycle is observed through increasing and decreasing numbers of sunspots, magnetic field strength, and other forms of solar emanations.  Humans have observed this cycle since about the 1600s, and these observations form one of the longer records of continuous human measurement.  Right now, in mid-2018, we're at the tail end of Cycle 24.  Solar minimum is predicted to hit around 2020.  

The flux of GCRs follows this cycle.  During solar maximum, the GCR flux is low.  During minimum, it's high.  When the charged GCRs pass through the Sun's farflung magnetic field, they experience a torque.  The net effect of this torque is that the GCRs don't make it very deep into the solar system before getting redirected back out again.  When the solar magnetic field is strong, during solar maximum, only a few, very high speed GCRs make it to the Earth.  When the field is weak, during solar minimum, more GCRs can get to us, including lower energy ones.  

At this point, it may appear that an increasing GCR flux is just a normal result of the approach to solar minimum, though this minimum may be some kind of super-minimum, and it's approaching super fast.  However, that is not the only story about the sun.

### What's down with the sun?

Back in 2011, the sun was nearing the top of its cycle, solar maximum.  At that time, I [filmed](LINK) a pedagogical video on a prediction that was made by three sets of researchers.  They forecasted that, based on observation and theory, the sun was going into a severe quiet period.  I followed that video with a [few](link) [additional](link) [pieces](link) to expand on the concept.

First, Livingston et al. were in the business of observing the solar spectrum inside of sunspots [[[footnote: The astronomers made these observations at the McMath-Pierce solar telescope, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the pyramids at Giza.  This telescope was just recently defunded and shut down.]]].  It is well known that, in the viscinity of a strong magnetic field, spectral lines can split into multiple lines - this is the so-called [Zeeman effect](link).  This splitting can be used to estimate the strength of the magnetic field.  Livingston et al. showed that the strongest magnetic field found in the smallest sunspots was about 1500 Gauss.  They also showed that the average strength of magnetic field in the sunspots was trending down over time.  They forecasted that, based on that trend, the next solar cycle may not produce a magnetic field stronger than 1500 Gauss - in other words, the sun may not have enough oomph to produce sunspots during Cycle 25.

A second group studies sound waves on the sun.  Ripples of gas on the sun, observed as a wiggling doppler effect on spectral lines, can be analyzed to reveal processes deep within the sun's interior.  A periodic feature the GONG group has identified using these helioseismic studies is the Torsional Oscillation.  This is a specific latitude band of gas inside the sun that rings with its own frequency.  As the solar cycle progresses, this band starts near the equator and moves toward the pole.  The GONG group showed that the strength of this band can be a predictor of the strength of the next solar cycle.  They showed that the torsional oscillation in mid-2011 was extremely weak, indicating an extremely week Cycle 25.

The third indication came from observations of triply ionized iron spectra within the solar corona.  I did an [interview with Dr. Altrock](link) back in 2011 on his observations, but here is the summary.  Triply ionized iron follows the sun's magnetic field.  As the cycle progresses, this feature also moves from the northern latitudes up to the pole.  The speed and strength of this "Rush to the Poles" indicates the strength of the next solar cycle.  Again, a very weak rush indicated a potentially very weak Cycle 25.

If these scientists were correct, then the sun may be headed for a Grand Solar Minimum, something we have not witnessed since the late 17th Century.  The Maunder Minimum was a period during which the sun sprouted virtually no sunspots.  Maunder recognized this in not only records of solar observations (which was new at the time), but also in records of auroral activity.  This event lasted some 70 years, and happened to coincide with an uncharacteristically cold period in Europe.  Since then, the solar cycle has picked up and popped out sunspots every 11 years or so.

One effect of another grand solar minimum would be a prolonged increase in galactic cosmic ray flux into the inner reaches of the solar system.  This is the signal that initially drew me to Schwadron et al.'s results.

While a higher GCR flux is bad news for astronauts, wouldn't that be offset by less solar activity?  In other words, if the sun goes quiet, there should be a lower flux of solar energetic particles.  However, that is not the case.


### A quiet sun?

A quiet sun doesn't mean a friendly sun.  During a somewhat deep solar minimum back in the mid 1800s, the sun cracked out an incredibly intense X-ray flare, which had an associated coronal mass ejection.  This Carrington Event caused fantastic electrical effects within the Earth's [nascent electric grids](link).  If such an event occurred today, it could cause blackouts on the scale of massive natural disasters, potentially worldwide.

Back in September 2017, the sun belched forth the largest X-ray flare in over a decade.  If this flare had been aimed at the Earth, it might have caused a modern Carrington Event.  Schwadron et al. (2018) spend time examining the effects of this event on the CRaTER instrument.  They concluded that ...

So, during what may be an approaching grand minimum, astronauts may face a dual threat - both from the galaxies as well as from an unstable star.


### What we don't really know

Looking forward, 















The Sun's magnetic field, also called the Intergalactic Magnetic Field (IMF), is our barrier against this onslaught of the galaxies.  If the prediction is right, and our sun is headed for a prolonged Grand Solar Minimum, then we are dead meat...


### ABSTRACT


------------------------------------------

On the other side of our full moon, the sun has been going through its own changes.  It is now near solar minimum, when sunspots are all but gone and its magnetic field has weakened.  Seven years ago, the sun was near solar maximum, with lots of spots and strong magnetic field.  But it was a strange maximum.

It was so strange, three different groups of heliophyscisists came together in [an announcement](LINK) that it may be the last solar maximum we see for a generation.  I reviewed the analysis in [this](LINK) and other videos at the time.

In short, three different sets of solar observations - [coronal](LINK), [helioseismic](LINK), and [magnetic](LINK).  All three, in their own way, indicate that the next solar cycle will be either late or weak, or even nonexistent.
