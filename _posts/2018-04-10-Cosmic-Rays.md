title: The Sun is dying!  Or is the Galaxy just getting stronger?
excerpt: The most cosmic rays measured in the Space Age say the Sun's magnetic field is getting weaker, but other evidence points to a resurgence of the solar cycle.  Who is right?

### It's been raining cats and dogs!

The quietest spot in the solar system is on the dark side of the full moon. On these nights, the moon blocks out all the sunlight, as well as all the radio and other electromagnetic radiation from the Earth.  It's the most serene spot in the solar system to do astronomy.  But, things have been getting louder there recently.

A report was issued a month ago by [Schwadron et al.](LINK) about observations by the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter's CRATER instrument.  This instrument was specially designed to measure cosmic ray intensity when the Sun is shielded behind our moon.  The report states that cosmic ray intensity is now the highest it has been since we started measuring cosmic rays, and it's getting more intense faster than [expected](LINK previous paper).

Cosmic rays are the electrically charged nuclei of atoms, hurtling through space at incredible speeds.  These little speed demons are generally thought to have been blasted out of supernovae, and then accelerated around the Milky Way and other galaxies by intense intergalactic magnetic fields.  They're so small and so fast that a few may have shot through your body in the time it took to read this sentence.

Sometimes, those cosmic rays hit other atoms.  When they do, the effects can range from cosmic ray showers [[???]] to, potentially, cancer.

[Schwadron et al.](LINK) showed that, if the cosmic ray hail keeps intensifying at the rate it has over the past five years, it will become an increasingly dramatic risk to our astronauts.

## What's up with the Sun?

On the other side of our full moon, the sun has been going through its own changes.  It is now near solar minimum, when sunspots are all but gone and its magnetic field has weakened.  Seven years ago, the sun was near solar maximum, with lots of spots and strong magnetic field.  But it was a strange maximum.

It was so strange, three different groups of heliophyscisists came together in [an announcement](LINK) that it may be the last solar maximum we see for a generation.
