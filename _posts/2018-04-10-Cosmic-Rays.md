title: The Sun is dying!  Or is the Galaxy just getting stronger?
excerpt: The most cosmic rays measured in the Space Age say the Sun's magnetic field is getting weaker, but other evidence points to a resurgence of the solar cycle.  Who is right?

### It's been raining cats and dogs!

The quietest spot in the solar system is on the dark side of the full moon. On these nights, the moon blocks out all the sunlight, as well as all the radio and other electromagnetic radiation from the Earth.  It's the most serene spot in the solar system to do astronomy.  But, things have been getting louder there recently.

A report was issued a month ago by [Schwadron et al.](LINK) about observations by the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter's CRATER instrument (abstract printed below).  This instrument was specially designed to measure cosmic ray intensity when the Sun is shielded behind our moon.  The report states that cosmic ray intensity is now the highest it has been since we started measuring cosmic rays, and it's getting more intense faster than [expected](LINK previous paper).

Cosmic rays are the electrically charged nuclei of atoms, hurtling through space at incredible speeds.  These little speed demons are generally thought to have been blasted out of supernovae, and then accelerated around the Milky Way and other galaxies by intense intergalactic magnetic fields.  They're so small and so fast that a few may have shot through your body in the time it took to read this sentence.

Sometimes, those cosmic rays hit other atoms.  When they do, the effects can range from cosmic ray showers [[???]] to, potentially, cancer.

[Schwadron et al.](LINK) showed that, if the cosmic ray hail keeps intensifying at the rate it has over the past five years, it will become an increasingly dramatic risk to our astronauts.

### The details

_Back in 2014, Obama was still president, and NASA's goal was to send astronauts into deep space, somewhere.  By "deep space", we mean beyond low earth orbit (LEO).  By "somewhere", we mean probably a trip to a near earth asteroid._

In 2009, the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter (LRO) launched with an instrument designed to study the cosmic ray environment around the moon.  This instrument, called the [Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER)](http://crater.sr.unh.edu/), was outfitted specifically to model the cosmic ray effects on humans.

In late 2013 through 2014, a series of articles came out detailing the initial findings.  One of these papers, [Does the worsening galactic cosmic radiation environment observed by CRaTER preclude future manned deep space exploration?](LINK), by Schwadron et al., definitively warned that it was looking pretty bad for the astronauts.

They combined cosmic ray measurements made by CRaTER with those made by the [Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)](LINK) to build a picture of the environment going back to about the year 2000.  They then used a model to relate the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux to strength of the solar cycle, as indicated by sunspot number, to go back to about 1950.  Combining these two sets of data (observation and model), they then were able to make a forecast about the GCR flux for the coming solar minimum, depending on just which minimum we end up with (more on this below).

They noted that, based on GCR flux measured by ACE during the previous solar minimum (~2009), male astronauts would have reached their recommended limit of GCR exposure within 400 days, and female astronauts would have reached theirs within 300.  Based on forecasts of the next solar minimum (~2019) enabled by the CRaTER observations, exposure times would decrease by about 20%:  about 320 days for male astronauts, and about 240 days for female.  Given about six months to travel from Earth to Mars, and then six months back, a crew would easily exceed their GCR dose rates and enter dangerous territory.

In the latest paper, [Update on the worsening particle radiation environment observed by CRaTER and implications for future human deep-space exploration](LINK), Schwadron et al. revisit this prediction, since we're almost in the middle of solar minimum.  They included estimates for how astronauts would handle large solar flares as well, using the X9 flare of September 10, 2017 for an example.  Their conclusion?  The 2014 paper overestimated the friskiness of our sun, and underestimated the intensity of galactic cosmic rays, by about 10%.  In other words, astronauts will be able to spend even less time than expected in deep space, because the cosmic ray environment was getting worse faster than expected.

Why was their prediction so far off?

## What's up with the Sun?

"That's a very good and a very hard question," said Nathan Schwadron, principal investigator for the CRaTER experiment.  "I am not sure why the dose rates are going up so quickly.  [But] I suspect two issues:"

"1) the magnetic fields in the solar system are weakening more rapidly than we anticipated.  This has the effect of allowing more radiation into the solar system."

Readers of this blog may know that I've been hot on this topic since about 2011, when I produced a video about the Grand Solar Minimum...





On the other side of our full moon, the sun has been going through its own changes.  It is now near solar minimum, when sunspots are all but gone and its magnetic field has weakened.  Seven years ago, the sun was near solar maximum, with lots of spots and strong magnetic field.  But it was a strange maximum.

It was so strange, three different groups of heliophyscisists came together in [an announcement](LINK) that it may be the last solar maximum we see for a generation.  I reviewed the analysis in [this](LINK) and other videos at the time.

In short, three different sets of solar observations - [coronal](LINK), [helioseismic](LINK), and [magnetic](LINK).  All three, in their own way, indicate that the next solar cycle will be either late or weak, or even nonexistent.
